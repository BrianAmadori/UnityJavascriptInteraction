# UnityJavascriptInteraction
Playground and showcase of an alternative and fast invocation method of managed C# code from Javascript.

## How to try:
1. Open the project with Unity (2019.4.0 LTS at the time of writing).
2. Switch the build target to WebGL
3. Build the project and open it in a browser.
4. The tests are run automatically. Open the browser's developer console to see the results logs.

## Fork changes:
This fork added a new test suite - sending of big structs from JS to Unity.
